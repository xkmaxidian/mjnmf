# mjnmf
This is code to do mjnmf “Community detection in multi-layer networks using joint nonnegative matrix factorization and topological structural information”. 

Running the " mjnmf.py" file

Some algorithms have been given on other authors so I just upload undisclosed algorithms. Datasets except amazon have been showed because amazon is too large. If you have any question or suggestion, please contact me. Email: 26889307@qq.com and Xiaoke Ma xkma@xidian.edu.cn

The coding here is a generalization of the algorithm given in the paper. mjnmf is written in the Python programming language. To use, please download the mjnmf folder and follow the instructions provided in the “README.doc”.
